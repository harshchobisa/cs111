In this tar ball, I have included this README, a MAKEFILE, lab1b-server.c, 
lab1b-client.c.

The make file has a few possible options. One can run make to compile both 
files, make server to make lab1b-server, make client to make lab1b-client, 
make clean to remove files from untaring, and make dist to create the tar ball
for submission.

I spent four hours on a bug in this project, only to realize the bug was
because I spelled the word received wrong.

I have used a couple of resources in my code. The first is the rpi 
socket programming tutorial linked in the spec. The second are TA slides.
The third is zlib.net. A lot of code has been references from these three 
sources.
